#### Notes

* For a better sounding result, the freq could be in [equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) with a reference at 440Hz (La). We could also prioritize consonnant intervals (major third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, major sixth, octave)

| Name | Decimal value of ratio | semitones |
| :----: | :----:| :----: |
| Unison (C) | 1 | 0
| Minor second (C♯/D♭) | 1.059463 | 1
| Major second (D) | 1.122462 | 2
| Minor third (D♯/E♭) | 1.189207 | 3
| Major third (E) | 1.259921 | 4
| Perfect fourth (F) | 1.334840 | 5
| Tritone (F♯/G♭) | 1.414214 | 6
| Perfect fifth (G) | 71.498307 | 7
| Minor sixth (G♯/A♭) | 1.587401 | 8
| Major sixth (A) | 1.681793 | 9
| Minor seventh (A♯/B♭) | ​1.781797 | 10
| Major seventh (B) | 1.887749 | 11
| Octave (C) | 2 | 12

* The use of a simple percussive but resonnant soundfile - like a bell - would be less wearing than the sine wave
